        The Importance of Sports in a Student's Life?
Sports and games enhance social relationships.
The students who are very much engaged in sports activities have a bonding capability. Here, they have to work as a team, which teaches them how to enhance a social relationship- which is also an important parameter of life.

Games make students emotionally strong.
Sports teaches students to be emotionally strong. Most of the students often have to deal with some of the other emotional issues in their life, either at home or in school. The skill they develop through sports helps them to accept all defeats as well as wins. Hence, students who loves games and sports are in a much better position to deal with tough situations.

It helps in building skills.
There are lots of games played at the school level,
 but the most common and important games are Cricket, Football, Tennis, Badminton, Basketball, and much more. Skills like teamwork, leadership, patience, discipline, learning from failure, Sportsmanship, 
 etc., are developed only when children play sports regularly, and these skills are equally important when it comes to studies and management. So, we can call it a crucial thing when it comes to skill-building.

Students have a great career in Sports. 
students gave a great career in games 
We often come across many children who are good at sports but not so good at studies. Also not to mention the countless sports type. 
So, for such students who don’t have that much interest in studies can make their career in sports as they value the importance of games</p> </h6>

<h2>Sports Eliminates Stress:</h2>

<img src="C:\Users\Sreenu\OneDrive\Desktop\Book Store\BookStore-Project\Image\Stress.jpeg" height="250" width="30%"><br>
<h6></p>Physical education help eliminate stress in students life
It is the responsibility of schools and institutions to train all the students in different games right from the primary section.
 <br>It is true that books develop our mind, but games develop our body too. Games are the best media to help children reach new heights, <br>
 be it scoring good marks in exams, be it staying fit and healthy, or be it completing the syllabus. Apart from education, games also provide mental, physical, and psychological development of a student. <br>
 To bring up a healthy spirit of competition among the students, to build up decision-making skills, and also to ensure the all-rounder personality of a student  games, and sports have been introduced and are applicable now in every school and colleges.

Not just these, there are even hundreds of benefits and advantages of sports and games!</p></h6>

<h2>Less influenced in the direction of Crime:</h2><br>
<h6><p>Several kinds of research have shown that children who are indulged in sports and physical activities are less likely to be influenced 
<br>in the direction of Crime. How? Being engaged in sports lessens the duration of unsupervised free time for them and puts a stop to apathy.<br>
 This prevents them from getting engaged in the habit of smoking, consuming alcohol, and drugs. With the passing time, it’s seen that students <br>
 who are involved in sports are better at studies and have adapted certain things such as goal setting, planning, and strategizing that play an 
 <br>integral role in their overall development.
</p></h6>
<h1>
  CONCLUSION:
</h1>
<h6><p>No wonder studies are important for a better future, but as parents, we all have to remember that our children can achieve the same goal 
  <br>despite having an interest in games. Only one of these two will not lead them to their goal. So, your children should get the habit of playing<br>
   from the early school days and carry on this as much as they can. This national sports day as parents, all we need to do is pick and choose <br>the most deserved school for our little ones where sports and other curricular activities are given equal importance as studies.
